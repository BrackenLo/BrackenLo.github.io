    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Mau was our Derby University final year group project, spanning the second half of the academic year.</p>
<p>The lecturers decided to combine all of the Computer Games Programmers (CGP) and the Computer Graphics,
Modelling, and Animation (CGMA) sudents into a single 'company', unlike previous years. As such, the team was
split into smaller sub-groups, each with a group lead.</p>
<h1 id="the-game">The game</h1>
<p>Mau is a boomer shooter game about the player who had their cat stolen by aliens and ventures out to get them back.</p>
<p>It was initially created using Unreal Engine 5.3 however was later ported to Unreal Engine 5.2</p>
<p>Due to licensing issues and uncertainty with the University, I am unable to provide a copy of the game, its assets or
source code.</p>
<h2 id="group-leader">Group leader</h2>
<p>With some of the most programming experience, I was made a lead for a group of 6 other programmers.</p>
<p>As one of the only members with Git experience, I volunteered to setup, manage, and maintain a Github repository
while teaching Git to the other programmers and some of the CGMA students. Due to inexperience amongst programmers,</p>
<p>Additionally, as one of the only members with Unreal c++ experience, I assisted with teaching many of the CGP
students with writing various systems in c++ such as health management, gun systems, vehicle movement with splines, enemy
navigation with visualisation and more.</p>
